# Email Deliverability Report & Solutions

## Issue Summary

The custom email with ID `ad3d3f94-d275-4cff-b5fb-e80861a53577` was successfully sent and marked as "delivered" by Resend, but the recipient didn't receive it in their inbox.

## Root Cause

**SPAM FILTERING** - The email is likely being filtered to spam/junk folder due to:

- Using generic `onboarding@resend.dev` sender domain
- Missing custom domain authentication (DKIM/SPF/DMARC)
- Email provider filtering of bulk email services

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Check Spam Folder First

The email was delivered successfully - check the spam/junk folder for:

- **From:** Trampolin <onboarding@resend.dev>
- **Subject:** "Just a test of custom email"
- **Date:** September 4, 2025 at 05:20 UTC

### 2. Configure Custom Domain (Recommended)

Replace the current email configuration in `.env.local`:

```bash
# CURRENT (problematic)
EMAIL_FROM="Trampolin <onboarding@resend.dev>"

# RECOMMENDED - Use custom domain
EMAIL_FROM="Trampolin <noreply@trampolin.ai>"
# OR
EMAIL_FROM="Trampolin <support@trampolin.ai>"
```

### 3. Setup Domain Authentication

1. **Add your domain to Resend dashboard**
2. **Configure DNS records:**
   - DKIM record for trampolin.ai
   - SPF record: `"v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all"`
   - DMARC record for domain policy

### 4. Alternative: Use Different Test Email

Test with a Gmail or other email service to verify delivery:

```bash
# Test with different email provider
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/emails/general \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userName": "Test User",
    "userEmail": "your-gmail@gmail.com",
    "subject": "Trampolin Delivery Test",
    "heading": "Email Delivery Test",
    "message": "Testing email delivery to different provider"
  }'
```

## Technical Verification

### Email Status Confirmed via Resend API:

```json
{
  "id": "ad3d3f94-d275-4cff-b5fb-e80861a53577",
  "to": ["tools@salestracker.ai"],
  "from": "Trampolin <onboarding@resend.dev>",
  "subject": "Just a test of custom email",
  "last_event": "delivered",
  "created_at": "2025-09-04 05:20:10.426776+00"
}
```

### Current Email Configuration:

- **Resend API Key:** ✅ Configured
- **From Email:** `onboarding@resend.dev` (problematic)
- **Reply To:** `tools@salestracker.ai`
- **Admin Emails:** `tools@salestracker.ai`

## Next Steps

1. Check spam folder immediately
2. Setup custom domain authentication for future emails
3. Consider using a dedicated email service domain (noreply@trampolin.ai)
4. Test with different email providers to confirm deliverability improvements

## Fixed Admin Page Issues

✅ All TypeScript/ESLint errors resolved in `/src/app/dashboard/admin/emails/page.tsx`
