# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Next.js SaaS Scaffolding Project

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: August 29, 2025  
**Status**: Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Overview

This PRD defines the requirements for a production-ready scaffolding project that serves as a starting point for SaaS application development. The scaffolding will be hosted on GitHub and provide a complete foundation with authentication, payment processing, data visualization, and file processing capabilities.

### 1.2 Business Objectives

- **Accelerate development velocity** by providing pre-configured, production-ready architecture
- **Standardize development practices** across the development team
- **Reduce time-to-market** for new SaaS products
- **Ensure consistent code quality** and deployment practices

### 1.3 Success Metrics

- Development team can set up and run the scaffolding in under 30 minutes
- Zero configuration required for core features (auth, payments, database)
- 100% test coverage for critical authentication and payment flows
- Successful deployment to DigitalOcean App Platform with automated CI/CD

---

## 2. Product Goals & Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Goals

1. **Developer Experience**: Create a frictionless setup process that gets developers productive immediately
2. **Production Readiness**: Include all necessary components for deploying a SaaS application to production
3. **Scalability**: Architecture that supports growth from prototype to enterprise-scale applications
4. **Security**: Implement industry-standard security practices for authentication and payment processing

### 2.2 Non-Goals

- This is a scaffolding project, not a complete SaaS application
- No custom business logic or domain-specific features
- No multi-tenancy architecture (can be added later)
- No real-time features or message broker integration (initially)

---

## 3. User Personas & Use Cases

### 3.1 Primary User: Full-Stack Developer

**Profile**: Experienced developer starting a new SaaS project
**Goals**:

- Set up a new project quickly without boilerplate overhead
- Focus on business logic rather than infrastructure setup
- Deploy to production with confidence

**Use Cases**:

- Clone scaffolding and have working app running locally within 30 minutes
- Add custom business features without modifying core architecture
- Deploy to production with minimal configuration

### 3.2 Secondary User: Development Team Lead

**Profile**: Technical lead managing multiple developers
**Goals**:

- Ensure consistent project structure across team
- Maintain code quality standards
- Streamline onboarding for new developers

**Use Cases**:
